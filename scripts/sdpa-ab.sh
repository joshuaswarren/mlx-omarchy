# SDPA f16-scores A/B runner. Usage: sdpa-ab.sh <before-sha> <after-sha>
#
# Two modes:
#   distinct-wheels   BEFORE != AFTER: builds both SHAs from detached
#                     checkouts, asserts the two wheels DIFFER, runs the
#                     SDPA equivalence suite on the after side (EQ_CMD
#                     default), then five pinned decode runs per dtype per
#                     side in one session.
#   same-wheel-gates  BEFORE == AFTER: builds ONE wheel, installs it in ONE
#                     venv, and A/Bs ONE named optimization gate on that
#                     identical binary. GATE_ENV must name the gate
#                     (MLX_OMARCHY_QMM_TILE, MLX_OMARCHY_ROPE_BF16_DIRECT,
#                     MLX_OMARCHY_SDPA_BF16_FAST, or a future fusion gate):
#                     side 'off' runs with GATE_ENV=0, side 'on' with
#                     GATE_ENV=1. No default gate is guessed; same-SHA
#                     without GATE_ENV is refused. A gate CHANGES EXECUTED
#                     CODE, so the identical binary proves nothing about
#                     semantics: EQ_CMD is REQUIRED in this mode (no
#                     generic SDPA default - the numerical case must be
#                     the gate's own), is executed with the gate ON before
#                     any timing, and nonzero aborts the session. Same-SHA
#                     without EQ_CMD is refused. MLX_DISABLE_COMPILE NEVER
#                     varies between sides (bf16 stays =1, q4 stays unset
#                     - the existing baseline), so the measured delta is
#                     the gate, not compile behavior. Both sides print the
#                     same wheel hash by construction; differences are
#                     GATE effects and must never be reported as binary
#                     differences.
#
# Generated IDs: every leg prints its generated_ids digest, and the
# runner COMPARES the digests at the end - across runs within a side
# and across sides per dtype. Equality is claimed only from that
# comparison and any divergence is a loud nonzero failure.
#
# Prints its PID first. Hardened 2026-09-04 (BenchmarkIntegrity):
# every path this script writes is unique per run (date+PID) - no
# rm -rf of shared trees, no venv collisions between reruns. Every
# command's exit status is checked EXPLICITLY; errexit is NOT relied
# on, because functions called in a conditional context
# (`build ... || exit`) run with it disabled. No pipeline can mask a
# failure: the wheel glob uses find -print -quit (no head SIGPIPE) and
# its emptiness is a loud error, and each bench run's python status is
# captured and fatal. One residual shared path: $SRC/dist is emptied by
# build-wheel.sh, so two concurrent A/Bs on one host still race there -
# the protocol is one session per host; if that changes, lock
# $SRC/dist.
