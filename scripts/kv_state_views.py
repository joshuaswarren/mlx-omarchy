"""KV state-slice eval-copy location probe (replaces kvcopy_decompose.py).

Answers, on the current tree, where the per-read KV state-slice copy is
produced and what the taken-read vs live-view contract is, with
self-verifying instrumentation: every stage must capture profile events,
and every stage carries an explicit verdict so silent zeros cannot pass
(the failure mode that retired kvcopy_decompose.py, which reported 0
copies in every stage without noticing).

Stages (synthetic arrays, cache [1,2,256,64] f16, offset 41):
  s1  slice-update write only        -> paste copies only (n=128); NO
                                        state-extent copy
  s2  state slice evaluated alone    -> CopyGeneralF16 n = offset*128
                                        fires with NO consumer: the copy
                                        lives at slice-eval time (the
                                        omarchy eval() densifier), not in
                                        any consumer. After the eval
                                        densifier is removed this stage
                                        records no commands at all; pass
                                        --expect-no-eval-copy to make
                                        absence (including an empty
                                        window) the expected verdict.
  s3  state read -> eager matmul     -> state-copy count equals the s2
                                        slice-eval baseline (the stage
                                        re-creates its slices); the
                                        consumer adds no copy of its own
  s4  state read -> fast SDPA        -> same as s3

Contract checks (bounded, synthetic), with the expectation built from
the KNOWN writes in numpy - the live view is never read, densified, or
otherwise evaluated until after the later writes, so the check cannot
pass on an early snapshot:
  live view    a lazy state view covering the next-write slot is held
               across subsequent slice-update writes and evaluated only
               afterwards; it must still show the pre-write values, and
               the writes must land in the parent (SliceUpdate allocates
               a fresh buffer).
  taken read   a state read taken and evaluated is a snapshot: later
               cache writes never rewrite it (verified over the FULL
               array against an independently built expectation, not a
               partial aggregate).

This probe is bounded to synthetic arrays; there is no model leg (model
benchmarks live in scripts/bench_decode.py). No backend behavior is
changed by this script.
