"""Client for the resident ANE worker (plan sections 24-27, phase 8).

One supervised ``mlx-omarchy-ane-worker --serve`` process serves every
submit of a pass: each named bundle is parsed once, its programs are
loaded onto the device once, and they stay resident, so N island
submits cost one process launch, one bundle load, and one device load
instead of N of each.

This is not an inference server (section 25). There is no socket, no
listener, and no user-managed daemon: the worker is a private child of
this client, it only ever reads jobs from its own stdin, every submit is
bounded by the worker's wall-clock deadline, and a failure is reported
and ends the session -- never retried.

Payloads travel inline on the worker stdin and stdout. They do not
go through host files.
